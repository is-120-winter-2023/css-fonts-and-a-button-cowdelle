        <h2>Hi! I'm Elley!</h2>
        <p>My name is Elley, and I am a unique daughter of God. I grew up in a small town, called Price, UT. I was
          involved in everything under the sun: ballet school, varsity soccer and swim, local government, musicals,
          choir, business clubs, science fair, and so much more.</p>
        <p>After graduating high school, I went to college for a year and then decided to take a break to serve a
          mission for my church. So I moved to Texas for about a year and a half to talk about Jesus!</p>

        <h2>First Came Love...</h2>
        <p>As a missionary, I constantly heard about the need to
          study the scriptures. With everyone studying the same thing in almost the same way, how could I make
          scripture
          study unique for me and those I was teaching? </p>
        <p>There were two girls who I worked closely with who had also attended college before they came to Texas. They
          were art majors and liked to paint in their free time. So I asked them to teach me!</p>
        <p>I fell in love with painting and started to paint scripture covers for anyone and everyone who asked!</p>

        <h2>Then Came the Art.</h2>
        <p>There were a lot of people who really liked my artwork! They told me I should start to sell it, but I was
          hesitant because I didn't want to lose the love of art that I had gained. I was afraid it would become
          something I <em>had</em> to do, rather than something I <em>love</em> to do.</p>
        <p>But as I kept painting, I realized that having personalized scriptures helps encourage one's love for
          studying the scriptures. If God gives you a gift, you've got to share it!</p>
        <p>So here is <em>Elley Cowdell Christian Art</em>. A place where you get to design art that speaks to you.</p>
